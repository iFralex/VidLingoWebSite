                    <h4>€1,000/month at the end of the first year and then exponential growth</h4>
                    <p>Large YouTube channels are very profitable. We expect to reach the first 100,000 subscribers in less than a year per channel. This is because we already have confirmation that the videos we will publish have already worked in a specific
                        country.
                        <br>The earnings will be very variable and difficult to predict with certainty, but expect to reach a minimum of €1,000 net after the first year of work, with the figure growing exponentially in the following months.</p>
                    <h4>Multiply your earnings with multiple channels</h4>
                    <p>If you manage more channels, the estimates presented will multiply, reaching to earn several thousand euros already in the first year of work.</p>
                    <h4>Zero earnings at the beginning</h4>
                    <p>To access monetization and generate profits, a YouTube channel must meet certain metrics, which will be satisfied after several months of production, depending on how quickly the channel will grow.</p>
                    <p>This means that at the beginning, the earnings for you and for us will be zero. After a few weeks, however, when the channel starts to grow, you will receive the first modest monthly compensation.<br>Only when the channel reaches large
                        numbers will you earn very substantial amounts.</p>
                    <h4>You will start earning in a few weeks to a few months</h4>
                    <p>Earnings will depend on the language in which you dub, the sector of the channel, the target audience of the channel, obviously on views and other metrics, so predicting how long it will take you to reach significant figures is impossible.
                        However, since you will be dubbing videos that have already proven to be successful in some countries, the chances that the channel will grow quickly are very real.</p>
                    <h4>You earn half of the profits</h4>
                    <p>Keep in mind that you will get 50% of the total earnings of the channel. The rest of the money will be invested to edit the dubbed videos, pay the rights of the content to the original creator, and cover administrative costs.</p>
