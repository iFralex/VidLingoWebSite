                            <h4>Which languages can I translate my videos into?</h4>
<p>From English, we primarily translate videos into Spanish. In addition to Spanish, we can also translate into other languages such as Portuguese, French, or Italian, but the translation into these languages will be considered based on the performance of your channel.</p>
                        </li>

                            <h4>Why should I trust VidLingo?</h4>
<p>Our earnings are solely dependent on the results of the YouTube channels we manage. This compels us to work our best to grow the channels as quickly as possible.</p>
</li></div><div><li>
<h4>Will my content be protected?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. Before collaborating, we will sign a contract for the rights transfer of your videos solely for translation purposes. There will be clauses to protect you in case of misuse of the content. We aim to establish a long-lasting and professional collaboration, so we are ready to provide you with all the necessary guarantees.</p>
</li></div><div><li><h4>How will the payment be processed?</h4>
<p>Your payments will be processed on the first day of each month and will amount to 25% of the total earnings from the channels we manage. You will receive payment via PayPal or bank transfer.</p>

                            <h4>Can I choose the voice actor for each language in which my videos will be translated?</h4>
<p>Certainly. We will provide you with a one-minute demo of your video translated and dubbed by our top voice actors. This way, you can choose the voice actor you prefer for each language by seeing them in action directly on your own video.</p>
</li></div><div><li><h4>Will you be transparent?</h4>
<p>Transparency is a priority for us when it comes to you. You will be a partner in every channel we manage, allowing you to see the statistics and earnings for yourself. Additionally, before publishing each video, we will send it to you so that you can judge it and provide us with your feedback.</p>
</li></div><div><li><h4>How many videos will you produce per week?</h4>
<p>In order to have active channels that grow quickly, we will initially publish 2 videos per week, with exceptions in special cases.</p>
</li></div><div><li><h4>Will all of my videos be translated?</h4>
<p>Our goal is to provide relevant and valuable content to foreign users. We do not translate all of your videos, but carefully select those with a broad global appeal. If a video focuses on local topics or is of little interest to an international audience, it will not be translated. Additionally, if a video addresses both global and local themes, we will remove the irrelevant or incomprehensible parts for users from different cultures, based on the judgment of our local adaptation experts.</p>
